# 🧠 Basic Digit Classifier (MNIST)

This project is a simple machine learning experiment that uses the MNIST dataset to classify handwritten digits from 0 to 9. It's designed as a beginner-friendly introduction to supervised learning using Python.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `classifier.py` – Contains all code for loading the dataset, training a model, making predictions, and evaluating accuracy.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras 
- NumPy


## 🚀 How It Works

1. Loads the digit dataset.
2. Splits the data into training and test sets.
3. Trains a basic classification model.
4. Evaluates model accuracy on unseen test data.


## 📈 What I Learned

- How to preprocess data for machine learning tasks
- How to train and test a basic classification model
- Understanding accuracy metrics and model evaluation
- Getting comfortable with hands-on ML experimentation
